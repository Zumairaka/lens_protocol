The recommended profile is queried from the polygon mainnet link protocol

For creating profile you need to connect your wallet first and then
mainly add the handle as the handle is stored in the blockchain
 and upon selecting a
file you need to wait till you gets a success message from ipfs
Only after that success message need to submit. But create
profile is not completed due to whitelist problem and 
couldnt check properly as the address is not whitelisted
I have done the function call and all. but couldnt check
